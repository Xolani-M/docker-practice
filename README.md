## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

docker-practice is a basic Node.js web application that showcases how to containerize a Node.js application using Docker. It provides a simple API built with Express, and the Dockerfile is included to help you understand the steps required to create a Docker image for the application.




## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

Before running this Docker demo, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Docker (Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS, or Docker Engine for Linux)




## Docker Installation <a name="docker-installation"></a>

Please refer to the official Docker documentation to install Docker on your operating system:

- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) (For Windows users)
- [Docker Desktop for macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) (For macOS users)
- [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) (For Linux users)





## Build Docker Image <a name="build-docker-image"></a>


# Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xolani-M/docker-practice.git 
```

```bash
cd docker-practice
```

# Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t username/your-app:2.0 .
```

    # NOTE: 
          Replace username/your-app:2.0 with the desired name and tag for your Docker image.





## Run Docker Container <a name="run-docker-container"></a>

# To run the Docker container from the image, use the following command: 
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 username/your-app:2.0
```

  Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

  #NOTE:
        When you run a Docker container with the docker run command, it starts the container in the foreground, and the terminal remains attached to the container process. In this case, you will not be able to execute docker stop directly from the same terminal where the container is running because the terminal is still busy with the container's process. Altinatively you can run the image on DETACHED mode, read further for more info.


# Run on Detached Mode (Background) using the -d flag:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 xomvana022/docker-practice:2.0

    
    - On detached mode the container runs in the background, and the terminal is free to execute other commands.
    - The docker run command returns immediately with the container ID.
    - You can still view the container's logs using the `docker logs <CONTAINER_ID_or_NAME>` command.
    - You can stop the container with `docker stop <CONTAINER_ID_or_NAME>` from the same terminal or any other terminal.




## Stop Docker Container <a name="stop-docker-container"></a>


```bash
docker ps
```
which will list the running images in this format
| CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAMES |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|4e3gg4455235 | username/app:2.0 | "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦" |  About a minute ago | Up 59 seconds |  0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp | wizardly_almeida

then from there, you want to select the ID or name

* Using IMAGE ID
```bash
docker stop 4e3gg4455235
```
* Using NAMES
```bash
docker stop wizardly_almeida
```




## Steps To Run The Program <a name="runimage"></a>

1. # Pull the Docker Image:
    ```bash
    docker pull xomvana022/docker-practice:2.0
    ```

2. # Run the Docker Container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 xomvana022/docker-practice:2.0
    ```





# You can do the previous steps by:
    1. Using your physical machine.
    
    2. Or go to host:labs.play-with-docker.com
    - Login/Sign In if you have a docker id or Sign Up if you do not have a docker id.
    - click "Start".
    - click "ADD NEW INSTANCE" to create a new virtual machine.

    #Tip: 
        - Maximize the terminal by clicking on it and pressing "alt" + "enter"
